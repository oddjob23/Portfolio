# Portfolio website
Personal portfolio website created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with purpose to showcase front end skills.

## Design and overall usage
 Site is built in pure CSS grid and HTML 5. As CSS preprocessor SASS was used in combination with PostCSS and autoprefixer for better compatibility on cross browsers.
 
## Goal
  The goal of this website is purely to showcase ability to create from scratch fully functionall personal website. Site is hosted at www.fullstackmaster.rs 
  
## Plugins and other libraries
  On this website two external JavaScript libraries were used, jQuery and swiper.js. 
  
## Back-end
 The only part that contains a little bit of back-end is the contact page. Contact page is operational.
 
### Future plans
 This project was built as a resuable component, each of the pages can edited or reused if wanted and I plan to apply more changes as I will create more projects, specially in Angular and React.
